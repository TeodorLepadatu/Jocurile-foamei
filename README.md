Help Ninu get through the ages!

For task management we're using [Jira](https://teodorlepadatu2004.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/backlog?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYzg0MjgyNjdlZWEzNDdmZmJkNjcxYWZiMDMyZDRiNTEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)


## Controls

ðŸ•¹ Movement
W / A / S / D or Arrow Keys â€“ Move the player up, left, down, and right.

Movement is analog: diagonals and smooth transitions are supported.

ðŸ§¨ Attacking

Q â€“ Launch a projectile in the direction you're moving.



ðŸ—£ Interacting with NPCs

H â€“ Talk to nearby NPCs when close.

Dialogue will be displayed on the screen if the NPC allows interaction.



ðŸ‘œ Picking Up / Dropping Items

P â€“ Interact with pickable objects:

If you're not holding anything, pressing P will pick up a nearby object.

If you're already holding an object, pressing P will drop it in front of you.

## Prompt engineering

We have used ChatGPT and Github Copilot mostly for fixing bugs such as:

- bosses teleporting from a minigame to another

- minigames not ending

- settings not saving properly

- ideas for some aspects of the minigames

## Other aspects

We also have unit tests, comments in the code and design patterns such as singletons for utility classes.
